 Exercise 1:
 In a highway, the minimum speed limitis 30mph and the maximum is 75mph. The following
 data set named speedLimits.csv describes whether drivers got a Ticket (T) or No Ticket (NT) given
 the speed of their vehicle. Create a scatter plot with the data points from the .csv file; use green
 color for NT and red color for T. Find the optimal Kernel (except for
 precomputed) for the SVM that separates the two classes.

 Exercise 2:
 Given the following dataset: breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.csv and breast-cancer-wisconsin-names,
 remove all rows that contain a ? (this should reduce the number of rows from 699 to 683). Ignore
 the first column (ID number) and assign the remaining columns to X (features) and Y (label).
 Apply Standardization, then PCA with PC=2, and perform classification using the SVM supervised learning algorithm.
 Create a scatter plot with the two different classes and a hyperplane
 line (use ’linear’ kernel). Print the accuracy of the model as well as the Confusion Matrix.
